# Story 3.3: Email Notification Integration

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** business owner,
**I want** to receive an immediate email notification when a quote request is submitted,
**so that** I can provide a timely response to the new lead.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Resend email service is integrated into the backend.
2. The form submission action from Story 3.2 is updated to trigger a formatted email.
3. The notification email is sent to a configurable address stored in an environment variable.
4. The email's body contains all the data submitted by the user in a clear, readable format.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 3.2 Foundation**: This story builds directly on the Server Action structure created in Story 3.2:
- Existing Server Action at `/apps/web/src/app/_actions/submit-inquiry.ts` with TODO for backend implementation
- Form validation and error handling patterns already established
- TypeScript interfaces (`SubmitInquiryParams`, `SubmitInquiryResult`) already defined
- Integration point with InquiryForm component already working
[Source: docs/stories/3.2.quote-request-page-api-endpoint.md]

### External API Requirements
**Resend API**: Configured for transactional email sending
- **Purpose**: Send all transactional emails (lead notifications, order confirmations)
- **Documentation**: https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/introduction
- **Authentication**: Server-side secret API key
- **Key SDK Methods**: `resend.emails.send`
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### Backend Architecture Patterns
**Serverless Approach**: Backend logic co-located with frontend using Next.js
- **Organization**: Server Actions (/app/_actions/) for data mutations
- **Pattern**: Type-safe API layer with integrated email services
- **Security**: Server-side validation and API key management
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

### Technical Constraints and Standards
**Framework Requirements**:
- **Next.js**: 14.x for integrated React framework with server logic
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for end-to-end type safety across application
- **Type Safety First**: All email operations must be properly typed
- **Server-Side Validation**: Validate all email data before sending
- **Centralized Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

### API Specification Integration
**Existing Mutation**: `inquiries.submitInquiry` handles quote and demo form submissions
- Current implementation: Form validation and basic Server Action structure
- Enhancement needed: Add email notification capability to existing Server Action
- Type safety: Maintain existing TypeScript interfaces while adding email functionality
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on unified project structure and backend architecture:
- **Email service**: `/apps/web/src/lib/email.ts` (new utility module)
- **Server Action**: `/apps/web/src/app/_actions/submit-inquiry.ts` (modify existing)
- **Environment config**: `/apps/web/.env.local` and `/apps/web/.env.example`
- **Email tests**: `/apps/web/src/lib/email.test.ts` (new test file)
- **Action tests**: `/apps/web/src/app/_actions/submit-inquiry.test.ts` (update existing)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Email Implementation Details
**Resend SDK Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
// Email service interface
interface InquiryNotificationData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  company?: string;
  message: string;
  subject: string;
}

interface EmailResult {
  success: boolean;
  messageId?: string;
  error?: string;
}

// Service function
async function sendInquiryNotification(data: InquiryNotificationData): Promise<EmailResult>
```

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Email failures should not prevent form submission success
- Log email errors for debugging and monitoring
- Provide fallback notification methods if needed
- Graceful degradation to maintain user experience

### Environment Variables Required
Based on external APIs and security requirements:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Secret API key for Resend service authentication
- `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: Configurable recipient address for business notifications
- Both variables must be documented in `.env.example` for development setup

### Security Considerations
**API Key Management**:
- Store Resend API key securely in environment variables
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use server-side only access for all email operations
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

## Testing

### Testing Strategy Requirements
**Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit tests with co-located test files
**Organization**: Tests co-located with the code they test
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for email service module (`email.test.ts`)
- Updated unit tests for Server Action with email integration
- Mock Resend client for testing without actual email sending
- Test success scenarios with proper email delivery
- Test failure scenarios with graceful degradation
- Test email template formatting and data presentation
- Test environment variable validation and error handling

**Test Coverage Areas**:
- Email service initialization and configuration
- Email template generation with user data
- Successful email sending with proper return values
- Email service failures and error handling
- Server Action integration with email service
- Environment variable validation and security
- Email formatting for various input data combinations

**Mock Strategy**:
- Mock Resend client to avoid sending actual emails during testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios of email service
- Verify email content formatting and recipient configuration
- Ensure Server Action continues to work if email service fails
