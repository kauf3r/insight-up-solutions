# Story 1.3: Database Setup & Prisma Integration

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Prisma ORM and connect it to a local SQLite database,
**so that** the application has a functional data layer for local development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prisma is added as a project dependency.
2. The Prisma schema is initialized with a placeholder model to confirm connectivity.
3. Prisma Client is generated successfully.
4. A server component can successfully query the local SQLite database via Prisma Client without errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Install and configure Prisma in the database package (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add Prisma to `packages/db/package.json`
  - [x] Install Prisma CLI and client dependencies
  - [x] Initialize Prisma in the packages/db directory

- [x] Set up Prisma schema with placeholder model (AC: 2)
  - [x] Configure SQLite database provider in schema.prisma
  - [x] Create a simple placeholder model (e.g., User or Test model)
  - [x] Set up proper database file location

- [x] Generate Prisma Client and test connectivity (AC: 3)
  - [x] Run `prisma generate` to create client
  - [x] Run `prisma db push` to create database schema
  - [x] Verify SQLite database file is created

- [x] Create database integration in Next.js app (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up database connection utility in `apps/web`
  - [x] Create a test server component that queries the database
  - [x] Verify successful database query without errors
  - [x] Test component renders data correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1 and 1.2 completed:
- ✅ Monorepo structure with workspaces established
- ✅ Next.js 14 with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated and working

### Project Structure Requirements
Database package must be created in the established structure:
```
/insight-up-solutions
├── /packages/
│   └── /db/           # Database package to be created
│       ├── package.json
│       └── /prisma/
│           ├── schema.prisma
│           └── dev.db (SQLite file, git-ignored)
├── /apps/
│   └── /web/          # Next.js app (existing)
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific versions:
- **Prisma**: 5.x - Next-generation ORM for type-safe database access and migrations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production, but SQLite for local development setup
- **Integration**: Prisma Client must integrate with Next.js 14 server components
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Database Architecture
From database schema design:
- Prisma will be the single ORM for all database interactions
- Database package should be reusable across the monorepo
- Repository pattern will be used for data access (future stories)
- Connection management for serverless deployment compatibility
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Coding Standards
Key patterns to follow:
- Type Safety First - All database models must be properly typed
- Repository Pattern - Database access through repository layer (prepare foundation)
- Centralized Environment Variables - Database URL and connection config
- Server-Side Validation - Database operations in server components/actions
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Database package: `/packages/db/`
- Prisma schema: `/packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`
- SQLite database: `/packages/db/prisma/dev.db` (git-ignored)
- Next.js integration: `/apps/web/src/lib/db.ts` (connection utility)
- Test component: `/apps/web/src/app/test-db/page.tsx` (verification)

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` for Prisma connection
- SQLite file path for local development
- Future PostgreSQL connection for production

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 14 App Router and Server Components
- Database operations should be server-side only
- Prepare for future migration to PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Connection pooling considerations for serverless deployment

## Testing
**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for database utilities using Vitest
- Integration test for Prisma Client generation and connectivity
- Test server component that demonstrates successful database query
- Verify SQLite database file creation and schema application
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Prisma Client can connect to SQLite database
- Schema migrations apply successfully
- Basic CRUD operations work through server components
- Database file is properly ignored by git

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - Implementation demonstrates high quality with proper architectural patterns, comprehensive error handling, and adherence to established standards. The database package is well-structured with appropriate separation of concerns and follows Next.js 14 App Router best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

**Database Package Testing Enhancement:**
- **File**: `packages/db/index.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive unit test suite with 9 test cases covering all CRUD operations, error scenarios, and edge cases
  - **Why**: Story required unit tests but none existed for the database package, creating a critical coverage gap
  - **How**: Implements test scenarios for connection, user model operations, constraint validation, and error handling

- **File**: `packages/db/package.json`
  - **Change**: Added vitest dependency and test scripts (`test`, `test:watch`)
  - **Why**: Enable proper test execution for the database package
  - **How**: Integrated testing framework consistent with project standards

- **File**: `packages/db/vitest.config.ts`
  - **Change**: Added vitest configuration for Node.js environment testing
  - **Why**: Ensure proper test environment setup for database operations
  - **How**: Configured timeout and environment settings appropriate for database testing

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Type Safety First implemented with full TypeScript coverage, proper naming conventions, server-side validation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PERFECT** - Follows monorepo structure exactly as specified, proper package organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **COMPREHENSIVE** - Unit tests cover all acceptance criteria, integration testing via test component
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **FULLY SATISFIED** - Every acceptance criteria implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Added comprehensive unit test suite for database package (packages/db/index.test.ts)
- [x] Configured testing infrastructure for database package (vitest.config.ts, package.json scripts)
- [x] Validated all CRUD operations work correctly with proper error handling
- [x] Verified singleton pattern prevents connection leaks in development
- [x] Confirmed SQLite database file creation and schema application

**Future Considerations (Low Priority):**
- [ ] Consider implementing database connection pooling configuration for production PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Add database migration strategy documentation when transitioning to production
- [ ] Consider adding database seeding scripts for consistent development data

### Security Review

**Status: SECURE** - SQLite database implementation follows security best practices:
- Database file properly located and isolated
- No sensitive data exposure in connection strings
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure
- Connection singleton pattern prevents resource exhaustion

### Performance Considerations

**Status: OPTIMIZED** - Performance characteristics are appropriate for the implementation scope:
- Singleton pattern prevents excessive connection creation
- Efficient query patterns with proper indexing (unique constraints)
- Proper transaction handling in test scenarios
- Ready for production database migration with minimal performance impact
