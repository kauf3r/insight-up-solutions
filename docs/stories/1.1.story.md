# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Next.js 14 project within a Monorepo structure,
**so that** I have a clean, version-controlled foundation for development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new monorepo is created using npm workspaces.
2. A new Next.js 14 application is scaffolded within an `apps/web` directory.
3. TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier are configured for code quality and consistency.
4. The project is initialized as a Git repository and can be pushed to a remote provider.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize monorepo structure with npm workspaces (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create root `package.json` with workspaces configuration
  - [ ] Set up proper workspace references for the `apps/web` project

- [ ] Scaffold Next.js 14 application in `apps/web` directory (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@14` with proper configuration flags
  - [ ] Verify Next.js 14.x is installed as specified in tech stack
  - [ ] Ensure app router is enabled (default for Next.js 14)

- [ ] Configure TypeScript 5.x for type safety (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript configuration is present
  - [ ] Ensure strict mode and proper compiler options are set
  - [ ] Validate TypeScript integration with Next.js

- [ ] Set up ESLint for code quality (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure ESLint with Next.js recommended rules
  - [ ] Add TypeScript ESLint integration
  - [ ] Test ESLint configuration with sample code

- [ ] Configure Prettier for code formatting (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add Prettier configuration file
  - [ ] Set up Prettier ESLint integration to avoid conflicts
  - [ ] Verify Prettier formatting rules work correctly

- [ ] Initialize Git repository and prepare for remote (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Run `git init` in project root
  - [ ] Create appropriate `.gitignore` file
  - [ ] Make initial commit with project structure
  - [ ] Verify repository is ready for remote push

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the foundation story.

### Project Structure Requirements
The project must follow the unified structure defined in the architecture:
```
/insight-up-solutions
├── /apps
│   └── /web/          # Next.js 14 application goes here
│       ├── /src/
│       │   ├── /app/  # App router structure
│       │   ├── /_actions/
│       │   ├── /components/
│       │   ├── /repositories/
│       │   └── ...
│       └── next.config.js
├── /packages/
│   └── /db/           # Database package (for future stories)
│       └── /prisma/
│           └── schema.prisma
└── package.json       # Root workspace package.json
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific versions and technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x - Integrated React framework for UI, server logic, and APIs
- **TypeScript**: 5.x - Ensures end-to-end type safety across the entire application
- **ESLint & Prettier**: For code quality and consistency
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards
Key rules that must be followed:
- Type Safety First - All code must be properly typed
- Use consistent naming conventions for components, hooks, API routes, and database models
- Server-Side Validation patterns
- Repository Pattern will be used in future stories
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- Root workspace: `/insight-up-solutions/package.json`
- Next.js app: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/`
- Source code: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/`
- App router: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/app/`

### Testing Requirements
Testing framework will be set up in future stories, but project should be prepared for:
- Unit testing with Vitest
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Tests co-located with code or in dedicated /e2e directory
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must be compatible with Vercel deployment (addressed in Story 1.5)
- Project structure must support future Prisma integration in packages/db
- Must support future shadcn/ui integration

## Testing
**Test Requirements**: No specific tests for this foundational story, but the project structure must support the testing pyramid approach defined in the architecture:
- Unit tests (Vitest) - tests co-located with code
- Integration tests
- End-to-End tests (Playwright) - in dedicated /e2e directory
