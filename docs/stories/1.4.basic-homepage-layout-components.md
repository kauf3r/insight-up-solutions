## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 completed successfully:
- ✅ Monorepo structure with workspaces established (npm workspaces)
- ✅ Next.js 14 with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated and working
- ✅ Database package with Prisma successfully set up and tested

### Project Structure Requirements
Components must be created in the established frontend structure:
```
/apps/web/src/
├── /components/
│   ├── /ui/           # shadcn/ui components (existing)
│   ├── /common/       # Reusable components (create Header/Footer here)
│   └── /features/     # Feature-specific components
└── /app/
    └── page.tsx       # Homepage to be updated
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x with App Router for routing and page structure
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety across all components
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **shadcn/ui**: Latest for consistent component patterns and accessibility
- **React**: Components must follow React.forwardRef pattern for proper ref handling
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Frontend Architecture Guidelines
**Component Organization**: Components organized into /ui (shadcn), /common (reusable), and /features (specific) directories
**Component Template**: All components must follow standard TypeScript template using React.forwardRef
**Routing**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with file system structure within /app
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
Based on component architecture requirements:
- **Template Pattern**: All components must use React.forwardRef for proper ref forwarding
- **TypeScript Interface**: Define proper props interfaces for type safety
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent design
- **Accessibility**: Follow accessible component patterns from shadcn/ui principles
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Header component: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Header.tsx`
- Footer component: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Footer.tsx`
- Homepage update: `/apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (existing file to modify)
- Common components directory: `/apps/web/src/components/common/` (create if needed)

### Coding Standards
Key patterns to follow:
- **Type Safety First**: All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Consistent Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names, kebab-case for files
- **Component Structure**: Export components as default with named interfaces
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind utility classes, avoid custom CSS unless necessary
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Data Models
No specific data models needed for this story - components are presentational only.
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Components should be client-side compatible but server-side renderable
- Follow accessibility best practices from shadcn/ui patterns
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints

## Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for components using Vitest testing framework
- Tests co-located with components or in dedicated test directories
- Component rendering tests to verify proper display
- Accessibility tests to ensure components meet standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Header component renders "Insight Up Solutions" correctly
- Footer component renders copyright text correctly
- Homepage integrates Header and Footer components properly
- Main content area displays Welcome message
- Components handle props and refs appropriately
- Responsive behavior works across device sizes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding implementation quality.** The developer delivered a clean, well-structured solution that perfectly balances simplicity with professional standards. All components follow React best practices with proper TypeScript integration, semantic HTML structure, and comprehensive testing.

**Key Strengths:**
- Proper React.forwardRef pattern implementation for ref handling
- Excellent TypeScript interfaces with HTMLAttributes extension
- Semantic HTML with correct ARIA roles (header=banner, footer=contentinfo)
- Responsive design using established Tailwind patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage (22/22 tests passing)
- Clean separation of concerns and reusable component architecture

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - code quality was excellent from implementation.

- **Tests**: Header.test.tsx (6 tests covering rendering, styling, props, semantic structure)

**AC2 - Footer Component**: ✓ COVERED
- **Given**: User visits the homepage
- **When**: Page loads
- **Then**: Footer displays copyright text with current year
- **Tests**: Footer.test.tsx (7 tests covering rendering, dynamic year, styling, semantic structure)

**AC3 - Homepage Integration**: ✓ COVERED

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Optimized for performance**
- Lightweight components with minimal rendering overhead
- Proper use of React.forwardRef for efficient re-renders
- Responsive design using utility classes (no custom CSS overhead)
- Dynamic year calculation occurs only on render (acceptable for footer)
