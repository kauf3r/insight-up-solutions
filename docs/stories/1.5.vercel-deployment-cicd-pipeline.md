# Story 1.5: Vercel Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure and deploy the application to Vercel,
**so that** I have a live preview URL and a validated continuous deployment pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The project is successfully linked to a new project on Vercel.
2. A push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a successful production deployment.
3. The deployed homepage from Story 1.4 is publicly accessible and renders correctly at its Vercel URL.

  - [x] Document deployment URL and access patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.4 completed successfully, providing solid foundation:
- ✅ Monorepo structure with npm workspaces established
- ✅ Next.js 14 with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated and working
- ✅ Database package with Prisma successfully set up
- ✅ Homepage with Header, Footer, and Welcome message completed

### Technology Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies for deployment:
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel - The hosting platform, providing seamless deployment and infrastructure
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.x - Integrated React framework optimized for Vercel deployment
- **CI/CD**: Vercel's built-in Git integration with automatic deployments
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Deployment Architecture
From deployment architecture specifications:
- **Platform**: Vercel for hosting and infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: Handled by Vercel's built-in Git integration
- **Automatic Deployments**: Preview Deployments for Pull Requests and Production Deployments on merge to main
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

### Project Structure for Deployment
Current monorepo structure requires specific Vercel configuration:
```
/insight-up-solutions
├── /apps/
│   └── /web/          # Next.js app to be deployed
│       ├── /src/app/  # App Router pages
│       └── package.json
├── /packages/
│   └── /db/           # Database package (build dependency)
├── vercel.json        # Existing Vercel configuration
└── package.json       # Root workspace configuration
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Existing Configuration Analysis
Current vercel.json configuration already present:
- Uses @vercel/next builder for apps/web/package.json
- Routes configured to direct traffic to apps/web
- Version 2 configuration format
- Ready for deployment with monorepo setup

### Environment Configuration
Required for deployment:
- Vercel project must be configured for monorepo structure
- Build command should target apps/web directory
- Environment variables may need to be set in Vercel dashboard
- Database connections (if needed) should be configured for production

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Should preserve all functionality from previous stories
- Deployment must be compatible with monorepo workspace structure
- Must maintain TypeScript build processes and linting

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Vercel config: `/insight-up-solutions/vercel.json` (existing)
- Next.js app: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/` (deployment target)
- Build output: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/.next/` (generated)
- Environment config: Vercel dashboard or .env files

### Coding Standards
Key deployment considerations:
- **Type Safety First**: Ensure TypeScript builds successfully on Vercel
- **Environment Variables**: Configure securely through Vercel dashboard
- **Build Process**: Verify all dependencies resolve correctly in cloud environment
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests continue to pass in Vercel build environment
- Integration testing of deployment pipeline functionality
- End-to-end validation of deployed application
- Verify build and deployment processes work consistently
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Vercel build process completes successfully
- All static assets and pages load correctly
- Homepage components render as expected on deployed URL
- Preview deployments work for feature branches
- Production deployments trigger correctly from main branch
- Environment variables and configurations work in production
