## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4, the following technical patterns have been established:
- Repository pattern is used for data access operations
- Server components are preferred for data fetching and SEO optimization
- Product data follows the Product interface specification with proper TypeScript typing
- Internal linking uses Next.js Link components for proper routing
- Testing follows co-located pattern with comprehensive unit test coverage

### Data Models
This story will primarily work with static content but may reference the Product interface for linking purposes:
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  type: ProductType;
  specifications: Record<string, any>;
  imageUrl: string;
  quoteOnly: boolean;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Component Specifications
**Component Organization**: Components will be organized into /ui (from shadcn), /common (reusable), and /features (specific) directories.
**Template**: All components will follow a standard TypeScript template using React.forwardRef.
**Routing**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with routes defined by file system structure within /app.
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Main page file: `/apps/web/src/app/solutions/page.tsx`
- Industry section component: `/apps/web/src/components/common/IndustrySection.tsx`
- Page test file: `/apps/web/src/app/solutions/page.test.tsx`
- Component test file: `/apps/web/src/components/common/IndustrySection.test.tsx`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js 14 App Router for routing and page creation
- Apply TypeScript 5.x for end-to-end type safety
- Use Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling with utility-first approach
- Implement server components for better SEO and performance
- Follow established responsive design patterns from existing pages
- Ensure accessibility compliance with proper semantic HTML

### Testing
**Testing Strategy**: A mix of Unit (Vitest), Integration, and End-to-End (Playwright) tests.
**Organization**: Tests will be co-located with the code they test.

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for Solutions page component using Vitest
- Unit tests for IndustrySection component with prop validation
- Test accessibility features and proper semantic structure
- Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
- Test internal navigation links resolve correctly to product pages
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Project Structure Alignment
- Solutions page follows Next.js 14 App Router pattern in `/apps/web/src/app/solutions/`
- Reusable components go in `/apps/web/src/components/common/` directory
- Co-located test files follow established testing conventions
- Maintains consistency with existing page layouts and component patterns
- Uses established Tailwind CSS utility classes and design system

### Coding Standards Compliance
**Type Safety First**: Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
**Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions for components and files
**Server-Side Optimization**: Use server components where appropriate for SEO benefits
**Accessibility**: Implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

Unit tests should be created for:
- Solutions page component rendering and metadata
- IndustrySection component with various props
- Navigation link functionality
- Responsive layout behavior
- Accessibility compliance

Test files location:
- `/apps/web/src/app/solutions/page.test.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/components/common/IndustrySection.test.tsx`
