# Story 2.2: Product Catalog Page

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to view a catalog page that displays all available products in a clean grid,
**so that** I can easily browse the offerings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new page is created at the `/shop` route.
2. The page displays a responsive grid of `ProductCard` components using placeholder data.
3. The grid layout adapts cleanly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
4. The page includes a clear heading, such as "Product Catalog."

  - [x] Add page metadata configuration for SEO

- [x] Implement placeholder product data (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create placeholder data array following Product interface from data models

  - [x] Reference Trinity Pro, Sony ILX-LR1, and Qube 640 as example products

- [x] Build responsive grid layout (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Import and use ProductCard component from `/apps/web/src/components/common/`
  - [x] Implement CSS Grid with Tailwind classes for responsive layout

  - [x] Apply consistent spacing and alignment following design system

- [x] Add page header and navigation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add "Product Catalog" heading with proper typography hierarchy
  - [x] Ensure page follows established layout patterns from existing pages
  - [x] Integrate with existing navigation structure

- [x] Implement unit testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Create `/apps/web/src/app/shop/page.test.tsx` co-located test file
  - [x] Test page component rendering with placeholder data
  - [x] Test responsive grid layout functionality
  - [x] Test ProductCard integration and proper prop passing
  - [x] Verify heading and content display correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- ProductCard component is fully implemented and tested at `/apps/web/src/components/common/ProductCard.tsx`
- Component accepts props: `{ name: string, image: string, summary: string, slug: string }`
- Component includes hover states, responsive design, and navigation to `/shop/[slug]` pattern
- All accessibility and TypeScript requirements already met in ProductCard component
- Component follows React.forwardRef pattern and includes comprehensive test coverage

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x with App Router for page routing (`/apps/web/src/app/shop/page.tsx`)
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety with proper page component interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x for responsive grid layout and utility-first styling
- **React**: Page component following standard Next.js page patterns
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Frontend Architecture Guidelines
**Page Organization**: Pages created in `/app` directory following Next.js 14 App Router structure
**Component Integration**: Import ProductCard from established `/components/common/` directory
**Routing**: File-based routing with `page.tsx` files defining route endpoints
**State Management**: Local state with React useState if needed for this page
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
Following established patterns from existing components:
- **TypeScript Interface**: Define clear page props if needed, proper exports
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive utilities
- **Grid Layout**: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox with Tailwind classes for product grid
- **Integration**: Import and use existing ProductCard component properly
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### Data Models
Product interface for placeholder data:
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string; // Use as summary for ProductCard
  price: number;
  type: ProductType;
  specifications: Record<string, any>;
  imageUrl: string; // Use as image for ProductCard
  quoteOnly: boolean;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure and Next.js 14 App Router:
- Page file: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/page.tsx`
- Page test: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/page.test.tsx`
- Import ProductCard from: `/apps/web/src/components/common/ProductCard`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Project Structure Alignment
- Follows Next.js 14 App Router pattern with `/app/shop/page.tsx`
- Integrates with existing component structure in `/components/common/`
- Maintains separation between page logic and reusable components
- Aligns with established testing patterns using co-located test files

### Navigation Integration
- Creates new `/shop` route accessible via browser navigation
- ProductCard components will link to `/shop/[slug]` dynamic routes (future story)
- Page should integrate with existing site navigation structure
- Prepare for future breadcrumb navigation if needed

### Design System Integration
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility patterns established in existing components
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes from current design system
- Implement responsive breakpoints consistently (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Apply grid layout patterns that work across all screen sizes

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 14 App Router navigation patterns
- Page should handle future dynamic product data integration
- Ensure performance with proper component optimization
- Support both static placeholder data and future database integration
- Grid layout must be accessible and keyboard navigable

## Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for page component using Vitest framework
- Test page rendering with placeholder product data
- Test responsive grid layout behavior
- Test ProductCard component integration and prop passing
- Test page metadata and heading display
- Co-located test files with pages being tested
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Page renders correctly with placeholder data array
- Grid layout adapts properly to different screen sizes
- ProductCard components receive correct props from placeholder data
- Page heading displays correctly
- Navigation and routing function as expected
- Accessibility features work properly
