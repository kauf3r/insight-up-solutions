# Story 2.3: Product Detail Page Template

## Status
**Done**

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion:
- Product data structure established with interface: `{ id, name, slug, description, price, type, specifications, imageUrl, quoteOnly }`
- ProductCard components in catalog page link to `/shop/[slug]` routes, establishing the navigation pattern
- Placeholder products available: Trinity Pro (slug: "trinity-pro"), Sony ILX-LR1 (slug: "sony-ilx-lr1"), Qube 640 (slug: "qube-640")
- Header and Footer components already implemented and tested
- Established page layout patterns using `min-h-screen flex flex-col` structure
[Source: docs/stories/2.2.product-catalog-page.md#dev-agent-record]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x with App Router for dynamic routing (`/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety with proper page component interface and params handling
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x for responsive layout and utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: latest for tabbed interface components (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent)
- **React**: Standard page component patterns with proper props and state management
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Frontend Architecture Guidelines
**Dynamic Routing**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with `[slug]` parameter for product detail pages
**Component Organization**: Follow `/components/common/` structure for reusable components
**State Management**: Local state with React useState for tab selection and gallery navigation
**Data Fetching**: Future integration ready for database queries, currently using placeholder data
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
Following established patterns from existing components:
- **TypeScript Interface**: Define proper page props with params: `{ params: { slug: string } }`
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive utilities
- **Component Structure**: Reusable Tabs component in `/components/ui/` directory
- **Image Gallery**: Responsive image display with Next.js Image component optimization
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### Data Models
Product interface for product detail display:
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string; // Long description for detail page
  price: number;
  type: ProductType;
  specifications: Record<string, any>; // For Specifications tab
  imageUrl: string; // Main product image
  quoteOnly: boolean; // Determines CTA button text
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure and Next.js 14 App Router:
- Dynamic page file: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Page test: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.test.tsx`
- Tabs component: `/apps/web/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` (if not already from shadcn/ui)
- Import existing components from: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Header` and `Footer`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Project Structure Alignment
- Follows Next.js 14 App Router pattern with dynamic `[slug]` parameter
- Integrates with existing component structure in `/components/common/` and `/components/ui/`
- Maintains separation between page logic and reusable UI components
- Aligns with established testing patterns using co-located test files

### Navigation Integration
- Receives traffic from ProductCard components in `/shop` catalog page
- Dynamic slug parameter corresponds to product.slug from catalog data
- Page should handle invalid slugs gracefully with proper error states
- Future breadcrumb navigation integration ready

### Design System Integration
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility patterns established in existing components
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes from current design system
- Implement responsive breakpoints consistently (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Apply shadcn/ui component patterns for tabbed interface

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 14 App Router dynamic routing patterns
- Page should handle future database integration for product data
- Ensure performance with proper image optimization and component structure
- Support both quote-only and priced products in interface design
- Image gallery must be accessible and keyboard navigable
- Tabs must follow ARIA accessibility standards

## Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for page component using Vitest framework
- Test dynamic routing parameter handling and validation
- Test tabbed interface component behavior and accessibility
- Test product data rendering with different product types
- Test responsive layout and image gallery functionality
- Co-located test files with pages being tested
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Page renders correctly with valid product slug parameter
- Page handles invalid slug gracefully with proper error state
- Tabbed interface switches between sections correctly
- Image gallery displays product images responsively
- Call-to-action button renders appropriate text based on product.quoteOnly
- Page metadata is set correctly for SEO
- Navigation and routing function as expected
- Accessibility features work properly for keyboard users

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Rating: Excellent**

The implementation demonstrates high-quality development practices with comprehensive test coverage, proper TypeScript usage, and adherence to Next.js 14 App Router patterns. The code is well-structured, follows established design patterns, and meets all acceptance criteria with robust error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Fixed CTA button text logic for non-quote products
- **Why**: Original code showed "Request a Quote" for both quote-only and regular products
- **How**: Changed conditional text to show "Add to Cart" for products with prices and "Request a Quote" for quote-only products

**File**: `/apps/web/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`
- **Change**: Improved error messaging for context validation
- **Why**: More descriptive error messages help debugging
- **How**: Enhanced error messages to specify "within a Tabs component" for better clarity

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated test expectations to match improved CTA button logic
- **Why**: Tests should reflect the actual behavior after code improvements
- **How**: Modified assertions to expect "Add to Cart" for non-quote products
