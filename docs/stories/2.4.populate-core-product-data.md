## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion:
- Product detail page template is fully implemented with dynamic routing `/shop/[slug]`
- Page component already expects Product interface with properties: `{ id, name, slug, description, price, type, specifications, imageUrl, quoteOnly }`
- Hardcoded product array exists in page component with placeholder data for Trinity Pro (slug: "trinity-pro"), Sony ILX-LR1 (slug: "sony-ilx-lr1"), and Qube 640 (slug: "qube-640")
- Tabs component is implemented for Specifications, Downloads, and What's in the Box sections
- Error handling for invalid slugs uses Next.js `notFound()` function
- Comprehensive test suite exists with 14 test cases covering all functionality
[Source: docs/stories/2.3.product-detail-page-template.md#dev-agent-record]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x with App Router for server-side data fetching
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety with Product interface compliance
- **Repository Pattern**: As specified in coding standards for data access abstraction
- **Vitest**: latest for unit testing of repository modules
- **Next.js Server Components**: For async data fetching in page components
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models
Product interface specification:
```typescript
enum ProductType {
  UAV,
  PAYLOAD,
  ACCESSORY,
}

interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  type: ProductType;
  specifications: Record<string, any>;
  imageUrl: string;
  quoteOnly: boolean;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
**Repository Pattern**: All database operations must be encapsulated within Repository modules to separate concerns. Even though this story uses fixture data, the repository pattern prepares for future database integration.
**Server Components**: Use Next.js server components for data fetching to enable server-side rendering and better performance.
**Type Safety**: Ensure end-to-end type safety across the entire application as specified in coding standards.

### File Locations
Based on project structure and coding standards:
- Repository file: `/apps/web/src/repositories/product.repository.ts`
- Repository test: `/apps/web/src/repositories/product.repository.test.ts`
- Product images: `/public/images/products/[product-name].jpg`
- PDF downloads: `/public/downloads/[product-name]-spec-sheet.pdf`
- Existing page: `/apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx` (to be refactored)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Project Structure Alignment
- Repository modules go in `/src/repositories/` directory following established pattern
- Public assets organized by type: `/public/images/products/` and `/public/downloads/`
- Maintains Next.js 14 App Router patterns with server component data fetching
- Co-located test files follow established testing conventions

### Database Integration Preparation
While this story uses fixture data, the repository pattern prepares for future integration:
- Database schema already defined in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Product model matches interface specification exactly
- Repository pattern allows easy migration from fixtures to Prisma client calls
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM ready for future connection
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Coding Standards Compliance
**Repository Pattern**: Use the Repository Pattern to encapsulate data access logic
**Type Safety First**: Ensure all data operations are properly typed
**Centralized Environment Variables**: Prepare for future database connection strings
**Server-Side Validation**: Validate slug parameters and data integrity server-side
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing page component
- Repository should return Promise-based API for future async database calls
- Product data must match interface exactly to prevent runtime errors
- PDF files should be optimized for web delivery (reasonable file sizes)
- Server component data fetching must work with Next.js static generation

## Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for repository module using Vitest framework
- Test both success and error scenarios for data fetching
- Validate data integrity and interface compliance
- Test async/await patterns and Promise handling
- Co-located test files with repository modules being tested
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Repository returns correct product for valid slugs
- Repository returns null for invalid slugs
- Repository returns all products in correct format
- Product data matches TypeScript interface exactly
- Page component integrates correctly with new repository
- PDF download links are functional and accessible
- Error handling maintains existing behavior
- Performance remains acceptable with new data fetching
