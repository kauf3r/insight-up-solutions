# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Next.js 14 project within a Monorepo structure,
**so that** I have a clean, version-controlled foundation for development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new monorepo is created using npm workspaces.
2. A new Next.js 14 application is scaffolded within an `apps/web` directory.
3. TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier are configured for code quality and consistency.
4. The project is initialized as a Git repository and can be pushed to a remote provider.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize monorepo structure with npm workspaces (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
  - [x] Set up apps and packages directories as per project structure
- [x] Scaffold Next.js 14 application in apps/web directory (AC: 2)
  - [x] Use Next.js 14.x as specified in tech stack
  - [x] Configure TypeScript 5.x integration
  - [x] Set up proper directory structure: src/app/, src/components/, etc.
- [x] Configure development tools for code quality (AC: 3)
  - [x] Install and configure ESLint with Next.js configuration
  - [x] Install and configure Prettier for consistent formatting
  - [x] Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode
  - [x] Configure editor settings (.vscode/settings.json)
- [x] Initialize Git repository and prepare for remote (AC: 4)
  - [x] Initialize Git repository
  - [x] Create appropriate .gitignore file
  - [x] Set up initial commit structure
  - [x] Prepare repository for Vercel deployment integration
- [x] Unit Testing Setup (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Install Vitest as per testing strategy
  - [x] Configure basic test structure co-located with code
  - [x] Create initial test configuration files

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundational story.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.x - Integrated React framework for UI, server logic, and APIs
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x - Ensures end-to-end type safety across the entire application
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest latest - A fast and modern testing framework for unit and component tests
- **Deployment**: Vercel - The hosting platform, providing seamless deployment and infrastructure

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The project must follow this exact monorepo structure:
```
/insight-up-solutions
├── /apps
│   └── /web/
│       ├── /src/
│       │   ├── /app/
│       │   ├── /_actions/
│       │   ├── /components/
│       │   ├── /repositories/
│       │   └── ...
│       └── next.config.js
├── /packages/
│   └── /db/
│       └── /prisma/
│           └── schema.prisma
└── package.json
```

### Architecture Foundation
[Source: architecture/introduction.md]
This architecture is based on the **"T3 Stack"** starter template, providing a pre-configured, type-safe environment and a solid, community-vetted foundation.

### Development Workflow Setup
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
The project should be configured to support these commands:
- Setup: pnpm install, cp .env.example .env, pnpm --filter db run migrate:dev
- Commands: pnpm dev, pnpm test, pnpm --filter db run studio

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Key Rules**: Type Safety First, Use the Repository Pattern, Centralized Environment Variables, Server-Side Validation
- **Naming**: Consistent conventions for components, hooks, API routes, and database models

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new files should be created at:
- Root package.json: `/insight-up-solutions/package.json`
- Web app: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/`
- TypeScript config: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/tsconfig.json`
- Next.js config: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/next.config.js`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit tests
- **Organization**: Tests will be co-located with the code they test
- **Test Structure**: Set up for Unit, Integration, and End-to-End testing pyramid

### Technical Constraints
- Must use exact versions specified in tech stack
- Must follow T3 Stack patterns and conventions
- Must prepare for future Vercel deployment integration
- Must support the defined development workflow commands

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: Co-located with the code they test
- **Test Standards**: Follow testing pyramid approach (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit and component tests
- **Test Organization**: Tests in dedicated structure supporting the defined workflow
