# Story 1.2: Core Dependencies & Styling Foundation

## Status
Complete ✅

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui,
**so that** I have the foundational styling and component system available for all future UI work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tailwind CSS is successfully integrated into the Next.js application.
2. `shadcn/ui` is initialized, and its CLI is configured correctly.
3. A basic `Button` component imported from `shadcn/ui` renders correctly on a page to verify the setup.
4. The global CSS file is configured with the base Tailwind directives.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Install Tailwind CSS via npm as per tech stack requirements
  - [ ] Configure tailwind.config.ts with proper paths for Next.js 14
  - [ ] Set up PostCSS configuration if required
  - [ ] Add Tailwind directives to global CSS file (apps/web/src/app/globals.css)
- [ ] Initialize shadcn/ui component system (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install shadcn/ui CLI tool
  - [ ] Run shadcn/ui init command with proper configuration
  - [ ] Configure components.json for project structure alignment
  - [ ] Verify CLI setup and component installation capability
- [ ] Install and verify Button component (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Install Button component via shadcn/ui CLI
  - [ ] Import Button component into a test page
  - [ ] Verify Button renders correctly with Tailwind styling
  - [ ] Test Button component responsiveness and accessibility
- [ ] Unit Testing Setup (Testing Standards)
  - [ ] Create unit test for Button component integration
  - [ ] Test Tailwind CSS class application and rendering
  - [ ] Verify shadcn/ui component imports work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Foundation monorepo structure established with Next.js 14, TypeScript 5.x, and development tooling configured. Project follows T3 Stack conventions.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui latest - Composable, accessible, and customizable components built on Radix UI
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.x - Integrated React framework for UI, server logic, and APIs
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x - Ensures end-to-end type safety across the entire application

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Organization**: Components will be organized into /ui (from shadcn), /common (reusable), and /features (specific) directories
- **Template**: All components will follow a standard TypeScript template using React.forwardRef
- **System**: Next.js 14 App Router with routes defined by file system structure within /app

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Based on project structure, styling files should be created at:
- Tailwind config: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`
- Global CSS: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
- shadcn/ui components: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- PostCSS config: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`

### File Locations
- Root app directory: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/app/`
- Components directory: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/components/`
- UI components (shadcn): `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- Configuration files: `/insight-up-solutions/apps/web/`

### Technical Constraints
- Must use exact versions specified in tech stack (Tailwind CSS 3.x, shadcn/ui latest)
- Must follow established monorepo structure from Story 1.1
- Must integrate with existing Next.js 14 and TypeScript 5.x setup
- Must prepare for future component development with proper organization patterns

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: Co-located with the code they test
- **Test Standards**: Follow testing pyramid approach (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit and component tests
- **Component Testing**: Test Button component integration and Tailwind styling application
