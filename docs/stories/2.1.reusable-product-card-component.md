# Story 2.1: Reusable Product Card Component

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a reusable `ProductCard` component that displays a product's image, name, and a brief description,
**so that** it can be used consistently on all catalog and feature pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `ProductCard` component accepts props for an image, name, and summary text.
2. The component styling is clean, professional, and responsive.
3. Clicking anywhere on the card navigates the user to that product's detail page.
4. The card includes a placeholder for a "Learn More" call-to-action.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 1 Foundation Complete:
- ✅ Monorepo with npm workspaces established and working
- ✅ Next.js 14 with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated and working
- ✅ Database package with Prisma successfully set up and tested
- ✅ Header and Footer components created following established patterns
- ✅ Vercel deployment pipeline working with live preview URL

### Project Structure Requirements
Component must be created in the established frontend structure:
```
/apps/web/src/
├── /components/
│   ├── /ui/           # shadcn/ui components (existing)
│   ├── /common/       # Reusable components (create ProductCard here)
│   └── /features/     # Feature-specific components
└── /app/
    └── /shop/[slug]/  # Future product detail pages
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these specific technologies:
- **Next.js**: 14.x with App Router for routing and Next.js Link/Image components
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety with proper interface definitions
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **shadcn/ui**: Latest for consistent component patterns if needed
- **React**: Components must follow React.forwardRef pattern for proper ref handling
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Frontend Architecture Guidelines
**Component Organization**: Components organized into /ui (shadcn), /common (reusable), and /features (specific) directories
**Component Template**: All components must follow standard TypeScript template using React.forwardRef
**Routing**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with file system structure within /app
**State Management**: Local state with React useState for this component
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
Following established patterns from Header/Footer components:
- **TypeScript Interface**: Define clear props interface with required and optional properties
- **React.forwardRef**: Use forwardRef pattern for proper ref handling
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and proper ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive utilities
[Source: architecture/components.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure and previous component patterns:
- Component file: `/apps/web/src/components/common/ProductCard.tsx`
- Component test: `/apps/web/src/components/common/ProductCard.test.tsx`
- Type definitions: Include interface in component file or separate types file if complex

### Navigation Integration
- Use Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- Dynamic route pattern: `/shop/[slug]` for product detail pages
- Pass product slug as URL parameter for future product detail retrieval
- Ensure proper href construction: `/shop/${product.slug}`

### Design System Integration
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility patterns established in Header/Footer components
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- Implement hover and focus states for better interaction feedback
- Consider using shadcn/ui Card component as base if appropriate

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 14 App Router navigation
- Component should be reusable across multiple pages
- Prepare for future data integration (products will come from database)
- Ensure performance with proper image optimization via Next.js Image
- Support both static and dynamic product data

## Testing
**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for component using Vitest framework
- Test component rendering with different prop combinations
- Test navigation functionality and click handlers
- Test responsive behavior and accessibility features
- Co-located test files with components being tested
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Component renders correctly with all required props
- Click handler triggers navigation to correct product detail URL
- Component handles missing or invalid props gracefully
- Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA) function properly
