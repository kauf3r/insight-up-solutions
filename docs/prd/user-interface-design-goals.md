# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be credible, technical, and clean, designed to build confidence with a professional audience. The interface should feel like a premium, reliable tool, prioritizing clarity and plain-English explanations over marketing hype. The primary goal is to guide users from learning and comparison to a confident inquiry.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
The core user journey is educational, allowing users to explore solutions, drill down into technical specifications, and compare products based on real-world data. This exploration should seamlessly lead to a clear call-to-action: requesting a quote or booking a demo. A secondary, more traditional e-commerce paradigm will exist for purchasing accessories.

## Core Screens and Views
* Homepage (highlighting the Trinity Pro and key payloads)
* Product Family Pages (e.g., for the Trinity Pro platform)
* Detailed Product Pages (with tabs for specs, media, and data samples)
* Solution Pages (showcasing workflows like mapping or agriculture)
* Product Comparison Page
* Demo Booking / Quote Request Forms
* Accessory Shop (simple grid/catalog)
* Shopping Cart and Checkout Flow

## Accessibility
The application must meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to be accessible to all users.

## Branding
The visual design should follow a **dark text on a light background** theme, using a clean grid layout. Imagery should be **payload-centric**, featuring high-quality photos of the sensors, equipment, and sample data outputs.

## Target Device and Platforms
The application will be a **Web Responsive** site, providing a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
