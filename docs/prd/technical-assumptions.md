# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
To simplify development, dependency management, and type-sharing for a single developer, the project will be structured as a **Monorepo**.

## Service Architecture: Integrated Serverless
The application will use a modern, integrated serverless architecture. Backend logic will be handled directly within the Next.js framework using **Route Handlers for API endpoints** and **Server Actions for data mutations**.

## Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
The project will adhere to a comprehensive testing strategy, including **Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests** to ensure quality and reliability.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* All specific technology and library choices documented in the Project Brief (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Prisma, Stripe, NextAuth, Vercel) are confirmed as foundational requirements for the architecture.
