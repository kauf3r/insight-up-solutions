# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Launch the Phase 1 MVP storefront by November 2025 to establish an initial market presence and begin lead generation.
* Position Insight Up Solutions as a premier, solution-oriented partner, distinct from competitors.
* Generate at least 10 qualified leads per month (via quote/demo requests) within six months of launch.
* Validate the e-commerce functionality through initial online sales of accessories.
* Lay the foundation for a Phase 2 release in Q1 2026 that will include the "Interactive Mission Hub."

## Background Context
The current market for high-end UAVs is fragmented, with resellers focusing on transactional sales rather than providing integrated solutions. Professionals in specialized fields like agriculture and surveying lack a trusted resource that combines hardware sales with the necessary workflow context and data validation. This PRD outlines the requirements for a platform that addresses this gap by creating a solution-oriented "mission hub" that builds user confidence and facilitates informed purchasing decisions.
